# product-purchase-prediction

## üìã Project Overview
This project implements a **Logistic Regression**,**K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)** plus a **Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier** model for a binary classification task using the `Social_Network_Ads.csv` dataset. The goal is to predict whether a user will purchase a product based on their age and estimated salary.

## üìä Dataset
- **File**: `Social_Network_Ads.csv`
- **Features**:
  - `Age`: Age of the user
  - `EstimatedSalary`: Estimated salary of the user
- **Target**:
  - `Purchased`: Binary output (0 = Not Purchased, 1 = Purchased)

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps Performed

### 1. Importing Libraries
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib.pyplot`
- `pandas`

### 2. Loading the Dataset
- Loaded the dataset using `pandas` and displayed basic info.

### 3. Splitting the Dataset
- Split the data into training and test sets using `train_test_split` from `sklearn`.

### 4. Feature Scaling
- Applied `StandardScaler` to normalize the features.
- Only applied to `Age` and `EstimatedSalary`; the target variable `Purchased` was not scaled.

### 5. Training the Model
- Used `LogisticRegression` from `sklearn.linear_model`.
- The K-NN classifier is trained on the training set with 5 neighbors and the Minkowski distance metric.
- The SVM is trained with the `linear` kernel.
- Trained the model on the scaled training data.

### 6. Making Predictions
- Predicted on both a single sample and the entire test set.
- Compared predictions with actual values.

### 7. Evaluation
- Generated a **confusion matrix** and **accuracy score**.
- Visualized training and test results using contour plots.

## üìà Visualizations
- **Confusion Matrix**: Displayed using `ConfusionMatrixDisplay`.
- **Decision Boundary**: Plotted for both training and test sets using `contourf` and scatter plots for the logistic regression model.

## üß† Key Concepts
- **Logistic Regression**: A linear model for binary classification.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)**: A non-parametric, instance-based learning algorithm that classifies data points based on the majority class among their k-nearest neighbors.
- **SVM**: A powerful supervised learning algorithm that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate classes by maximizing the margin between them.
- **Feature Scaling**: Standardization of features to improve model performance.
- **Train-Test Split**: Dividing data into training and testing subsets.
- **Confusion Matrix**: A table to evaluate classification performance.
- **Decision Boundary**: Visual representation of the model's classification regions.

The visualization code for decision boundaries is included but may not be directly applicable to datasets with more than two features. It is provided for educational purposes.
